#### Echo is a two-person team project developed during the [Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-bootcamp).

### It is a ReactJS web app designed to allow its users to search for and save Youtube videos to their profile and save specific time snippets to that, which they can later play in a loop.

#### Tech stack

Our app is powered by the Youtube search APIâ€‹. We built our client side using the Create React App toolchain and used React Router for the front-end routes.
Once the functional part of the website was built, we applied a touch of React Bootstrap components and a spoonful of SASS.

#### To run

The app has a Node.js back-end that needs to be run in parallel. To start the front-end run `npm start`.
